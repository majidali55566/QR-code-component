## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

At first it was little difficult to figure out how to make it responsive but after some time spent i realized i was lacking appropriate css knowledge about flexbox then i learned it. after doing so i was able to solve it.

### Continued development

    After some time i spent on the project i realized that writing code requires contineous development and learning
    since i intend to work on the project on time to time after learning some advanced css topics.

### Useful resources

- [Dev grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0A7moLkAL0) - This helped me for flexbox. I really liked this tutorial and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
